## The goal of this project is to implement a decision tree classifier to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their physical attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project involves training the model, evaluating its performance, visualizing the decision tree, and interpreting the classification rules.

## Steps: 
# Convert the data into a Pandas DataFrame for better visualization and manipulation.
# Split the data into features (x) and target (y).
# Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (70%-30%) using train_test_split.
# Train a Decision Tree Classifier using the Gini impurity criterion with a maximum tree depth of 3 for better interpretability.
# Fit the model on the training data.
# Evaluate the model’s performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy and classification report.
# Visualize the decision tree using sklearn.tree.plot_tree.
# Export the decision rules in a human-readable format using export_text.

## Tools and Libraries:
# Python: Programming language used for implementation.
# Scikit-learn: For dataset loading, model training, and visualization.
# Matplotlib: For visualizing the decision tree.
# Pandas: For dataset manipulation.
# Jupyter Notebook: For code execution and visualization.
